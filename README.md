Concept for a school website, where the user can make a request for enrollment, check out the school's education standards and practices, and also login, where they will have acess to a student home page, with information about their classes and grades, contact info for teachers and the school, and their personal information that can be edited at the 'profile' page. 

To create a user, you need to make a request. After your information is accepted you will be shown a randomly created password and your account's code, which needs to be used the first time you login in the account. 

All user data is managed using localStorage. The projects uses Vue.js 3, Vuex and Vue Router.
